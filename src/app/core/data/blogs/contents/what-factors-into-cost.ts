<p class="color-cape-cod">Thanks to a free marketplace, contractors are able to price jobs however they want and it’s up to the discretion of the customer to decide if they want to move forward. That’s what’s great about our country, living the American dream and owning a business. However, there are many other factors that go into calculating the cost of your project, that when they are not standardized for estimating, prevents you from accurately comparing contractors pricing apples to apples.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod">Your hardscape project is an investment and going with the cheapest contractor isn’t always the right decision. Granted, there might be situations where cost is the ultimate factor, for example, a quick patio repair. However, for customers who are looking at their project as an investment, there are many other factors to consider when choosing a contractor to build your new outdoor living space.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-70">Let’s take a look at the 5 factors that determine how the cost of your project is calculated.</p>
<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">#1 Bigger vs. Smaller Companies</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod">For starters, you need to understand that there are two distinct categories of contractors; small and large companies. Based on the type of contractor you go with, you will notice a major difference between their pricing, and the overall experience you will have with your project.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod">There are many benefits of working with a small company. One benefit is you most likely get to deal directly with the owner, because they typically work on site, with their crew. Many customers enjoy working with a company that’s ‘owner-operated’ because they feel a connection to the contractor. However, these contractors tend to get overwhelmed pretty easy, they can be hard to get back in contact with if you have a problem and many times they don’t have the right size equipment or experience for larger projects.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod">On the other hand, larger companies can be great for big projects. Large scale projects typically involve coordinating multiple contractors, and larger companies have more resources, equipment, and can handle any type of project with ease. They also provide in-depth designs but this all comes at a cost to the customer. Although there are times that working with a large local company is necessary; for most residential projects, working with a reputable small company is found to be the most economical.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">With United Hardscapes, you get the local small business passion, customer support and prices with the large company industry experience, network and equipment to get any size project completed.

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">#2 Material Choice</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod">The next factor that makes up the cost of your project is the material choice. Materials such as pavers, bluestone, natural stone, and stamped concrete all vary drastically in price. Even if you know you want a specific product like pavers, the prices vary based on style and manufacturer.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod">Is each contractor pricing your project using the same materials? If not, it can be nearly impossible to compare quotes. There are different quality materials and it makes a difference in the price and durability of your project.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">When you submit your project to United Hardscape, your project consultant will educate you on the options and provide simple to understand pricing for you to be able to review and compare.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">#3 Project Design</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod">Consider the overall design of the project. Does the contractor charge extra for different borders; inlays or designs? Some contractors don’t have any upcharge for simple border designs, while others do. Designs can vary in costs, depending on their complexity.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">It's important that you understand what's included in your project and what could become an extra charge. At United Hardscapes we provide customers hundreds of options and combinations at no additional cost. Ask your project consultant about our “signature designs” to make your project stand out.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">#4 Project Specifications</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod">Project specifications is the checklist contractors review to determine what it will take to complete your project. When a contractor has all the project details, measurements, a sketch and detailed project description, they will typically calculate the price of the project by the square footage.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">Things like; soil type, grade, and site access have implementations on the final square footage and price. For example an area with clay soil and more wet conditions will require a thicker base and potentially drainage below/behind the project. Where a project located in a sandy area would require only a standard base and no drainage. Your project consultant will check all of this during their site visit to ensure the proper specifications for your project.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">#5 Installation Process</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod">Above all, the most important factor to both the cost and durability of your project is the installation process. Regardless of the materials you choose, the design or size of your project, if a contractor slacks on the base and skips steps during the installation process, your project is at risk of failure.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod">How will you know if your contractors’ process meets industry standards? What happens if a contractor factors a 6” of base and another contractor quotes you at 12”? What if one contractor says they will use geotextile fabric and the other will not?  What about cleanup?  Does the price quoted include topsoil?</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-45">These are all part of a project’s durability and cost. With United Hardscapes, our proposals detail our installation process, and each crew documents their progress on each project ensuring proper installation at all times so that you as the customer can have peace of mind.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">Requesting Estimates</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod">When requesting estimates we feel its best to provide customers with the most efficient way possible to determine if now is the time or not to do their project. What we mean by this is actually getting a project budget put together. Many customers have no idea what a project might cost and many contractors are reluctant to give a ballpark number before going on site. Not United Hardscapes, with our virtual estimate form, we ask you key questions about your project, request some photos and guide you through what to think about when planning your project.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">Once your estimate is submitted, a local project consultant will review the details and be able to provide you a detailed estimate, from there if the estimate is within your budget, you will be able to automatically set up a site visit so we can discuss more details and provide you a final proposal. If this estimate is over your budget, no worries you can simply click “Decline” continue to use our platform to get ideas and when you're ready we will be here to serve you.</p>

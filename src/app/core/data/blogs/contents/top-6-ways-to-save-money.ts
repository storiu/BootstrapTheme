<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">Choose a Smaller Paver</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">Some contractor’s square foot price doesn’t change based on the paver you’ve chosen, and that’s great. However, many contractors' square footage price varies based on the paver style and size. Smaller pavers come in many sizes but the most popular is the traditional 6 by 6, 6 by 9, or 4 by 8. Choosing a small paver does not limit your design options, they’ve been around for many years and are extremely durable. Most large driveways and pool areas are completed using smaller pavers and look wonderful. Depending on the size of your project, choosing a smaller paver could save you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">Keep Excess Dirt on Site</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">This does not work for everyone, but if you have woods around you or have an area where you can store the excess dirt, so the contractor doesn’t have to haul it out, this could save you some serious money. By keeping the dirt on site, not only do you increase the contractor's productivity, but you also save on the haul out fees. Another perk of keeping the dirt on site, is you can save it for projects, such as filling in holes, or leveling an area in your yard.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">Time Your Project Approximately</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">There are busy and slow seasons in all industries, and trust us, Hardscaping is no exception. If you can, it’s always best to plan your project in advance. For example, if you are looking for a Spring project, it’s best to plan it out in the fall and put a deposit down for the Spring. Contractors are usually looking to pre-book their Spring schedule, and when you book the year before, most of the time you are guaranteed last season's pricing. (It’s common for a hardscapers price to adjust each year.) Late summer, July til the end of August are typically slower months in the hardscape industry, so we also recommend booking during these months to save money.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">Use the Same Size Block</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">If you’re looking to save money on a retaining wall project, it’s a wise choice to use wall blocks that are all the same size. A popular choice is the standard square foot block. This is a beautiful block that comes in many different colors, is very easy for contractors to work with and is very economically priced. For pavers, it’s important to choose paver combinations that are the same thickness to save money. Contractors have to adjust their base to accommodate different material thickness, so keeping it the same will avoid increased costs.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">Avoid Tumbled and Wetcast Materials</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod mb-50">Have you ever looked at a hardscape project and noticed the pavers look like they’ve been there forever? For example, dinged up corners, more rusted looking or scratched up. This is just a style, but customers pay extra for this, similar to how people pay extra for holes in their jeans. This damaged style costs way more than most homeowners realize, so if you’re looking to save money, we recommend avoiding these tumbled styles on your hardscape project. Additionally, wetcast pavers are new to the industry and though they have promise they are still having color issues and their price per square foot simply doesn't justify the cost vs a regular paver.</p>

<h3 class="text-primary mb-15">Bundle Your Project</h3>
<p class="color-cape-cod">Completing your project in phases might seem like the most affordable solution, but it can actually wind up costing you more in the end. A large portion of your final bill consists of the delivery fees from all the materials arriving and being hauled. If you can bundle all your projects together and complete your hardscape project at once, you could save hundreds in delivery fees alone. Additionally, many contractors will offer better prices on larger projects.</p>
<p class="color-cape-cod">Although, there are plenty of other tips and tricks that are project-specific, such as reducing material waste, re-shaping/adjusting original plans and utilizing a combination of materials to get the most bang for your buck. All of these things can be addressed with your United Hardscapes project consultant.</p>

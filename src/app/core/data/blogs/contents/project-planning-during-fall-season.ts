        <p class="color-cape-cod">While it may not seem obvious, Fall is the best time to start planning and designing your project. Here's why:</p>

            <p class="color-cape-cod">Many property owners think that cold weather puts the brakes on the installation of hardscapes. While many traditional landscape companies do shift gears in the fall and switch to cleanup mode, United Hardscapes continues to do hardscapes installations through mid-December or later. Installing a patio or backyard landscape is not limited by cold weather, and we work until the ground freezes.</p>

            <div class="medium-dot bg-primary mt-5 mr-10"></div>
            <p class="color-cape-cod">During the fall, ground conditions are ideal for a backyard project. Doing your project in the fall reduces the amount of yard disruption since the slightly colder and harder ground does not sink or slip under our equipment like it would during the wet spring months. It’s also best to plant grass in the fall and then overseed in the spring.</p>

            <div class="medium-dot bg-primary mt-5 mr-10"></div>
            <p class="color-cape-cod mb-40">You can get better prices on pavers and materials. Fall is the best time to find great deals on hardscape projects (or any outdoor project, for that matter). Prices are adjusted prior to the spring season, and we have not seen prices decrease from year to year. To get the best deal, it’s important to get your project planned and scheduled in the fall, even if your project installation date is in the spring. United Hardscapes will honor 2020 prices for any project in 2021, giving you the ability to lock in prices.</p>

            <p class="color-cape-cod">It’s easier to schedule your project ahead of time. When you plan your project during the fall, you are one step ahead of the spring rush. This pays big benefits by getting you a guaranteed spot on the schedule and securing prior-year pricing. If you wait until spring to schedule your projects, there may be a 2-3 month wait before your project can be scheduled. Plus, you will be able to finish your project ahead of everyone else’s, meaning that you can enjoy your new backyard all summer long.</p>

            <p class="color-cape-cod">Planning a bit early can give you time to think about your project, and plan it more carefully. If you plan your project in the fall, you can secure an installation date with a small deposit. Then you can work with your United Hardscapes Project Consultant to develop a 3D model of your finished project and make any changes that you’d like. We can easily accommodate changes before your project starts. While increasing the scope of your project, like adding a sitting wall, will change the overall cost of your project, we don’t charge any change fees or redesign fees.</p>

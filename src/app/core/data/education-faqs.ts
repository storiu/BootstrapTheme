        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No, pavers done with a proper base, proper bedding and installed with a high end polymeric sand will never have weeds coming through the pavers. At United Hardscapes, we use only the highest quality materials to ensure that you enjoy your project for many years to come. If you have weeds growing through your pavers, please contact us to talk about how we can install a new patio or driveway.</p>`

        name: 'Why do some old walkways and patios seem to have weeds or ants with them?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">A Lot has changed over the years with the installation process of pavers including the base material and fill materials. Most of these old projects don’t have the right foundation or the right sand and sand filling the joints,  allowing weeds to grow. Today's processes have been updated to prevent this.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do pavers crack?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Very rarely, If a paver were to crack for some reason it is very easy to switch out and replace without even noticing.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Are there cleaners for pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes there are a variety of paver safe cleaners on the market, we recommend (Techni-seal)brand cleaners.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can I power wash pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes you can power wash pavers if you choose to. We advise you to be mindful of the polymeric sand and if you remove too much poly sand you should re-apply as soon as possible.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What are pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Pavers are a pressurized concrete block that is nearly 3x as strong as poured concrete, pavers come in all shapes, sizes and colors.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can pavers be used in driveways?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, Pavers are a great option for driveways even in areas where it's cold and there is snow. We have installed many beautiful paver driveways. Whether your home is old or new, a paver driveway is a great home updating project that adds value and attractiveness to your property.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Why do some of my new pavers have white spots?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">These white spots are called effolesance, this is actually in the concrete block when its made, over the first 6 months of the new paver installation you may see this wash out of the concrete block, it's perfectly normal and naturally washes away with weather. There is also a cleaner on the market that will help speed up the process. On average it dissipates within about 30 days from installation, depending on the weather.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Does the water run off or through pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Most pavers are non-permeable, meaning the water will run off them. We also offer permeable pavers as an option. With these pavers, waterwill run through the cracks and into the base or drainage system.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can my gutter run onto my pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes it can, as long as there is proper slope away from the house and you don’t mind a bit more maintenance of maintaining polymeric sand in that area.  However, we suggest installing the gutters under the walkway and into a dry well or exit to daylight. Other options are available if you have a flower bed between your paver patio and gutter.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do I need to seal my new pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No, in fact we discourage sealing new pavers since it's just not needed and adds future maintenance.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do my pavers change color when they are wet?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">While your pavers don’t change color when they are wet, they may have a different shade or look more vibrant when wet. They will return to their original color when they dry. It's best to choose colors of pavers when they are dry since that's the way you will see your patio the most.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Are pavers more money than bluestone or natural stone?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No pavers are actually a less expensive better quality product than either of the other stones.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can I use snow melt on my pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, however there are some exceptions with certain products so be sure to ask your project consultant if you have any questions. It is recommended to use a concrete safe snow melt and if you are interested, we offer an optional heated paver solution.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can my old pavers be refurbished?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, there are cleaners and sealers on the market that help to color boast old pavers back to life.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What happens if a repair is needed with my pavers?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">With pavers any type of repair is simple, because all the pieces are individually put together its easy to pick up a section and either repair or switch out with little to no obvious fix. You can’t say this about stamped concrete.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Are there a difference in paver qualities?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, though it may seem like minor things from the outside looking in, with our experience we know what to look for and the difference between pavers that last the long term and don’t. Your project consultant will help educate you on the differences during your site visit.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do my pavers get hot in the sun?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">When it's summer and the sun is blaring down, things can get a little toasty but it's by no means unbearable. Most of our clients are able to walk barefoot on their paver patios with no issues. Especially when compared to Bluestone, Bluestone gets extremely hot during the summer sun.</p>`

      {
        name: 'How wide should my walkway be?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">The average walkway is 4’ wide this is pretty standard with all houses, however larger houses or customers who are looking for a more grand entrance will choose to do a 5’ wide walkway. Occasionally we can do smaller width walkways, but due to the core pavers/ border combo its important to make sure you have enough width in the field so that the walkway looks right. Your project consultant can explain in more detail and show you examples.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Should I do my walkway or driveway first?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">We highly recommend doing the walkway before the driveway, It's not only important to keep your new driveway “Clean” but also structurally walkways are strong when the asphalt is “Bonded” to the new walkway vs us cutting a new driveway and going up to it.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Should I do a border on my walkway?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes we recommended doing a border along the walkway, it helps to outline the walkway, secure the cuts and provides a clean look that leads to the final destination. Many walkways will even include a double border. Click here to see more examples of walkways with borders</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Will my sprinklers near the walkway have to be moved?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">This is project dependent, however if there are sprinklers right next to the walkway, yes they should be removed and “Moved/adjusted” by the sprinkler company after the project is complete.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What size pavers should I use in my walkway?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Just because your doing a walkway does not mean you are limited on your paver choices; we have designed many walkway projects using many size pavers and borders creating unique entrances for every situation.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'How wide do you have to dig for a walkway?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">We take pride in our installation process and the long term durability, but in order to ensure this we need to make sure there is a proper amount of base, even though your walkway may only be 4’ wide we plan a minimum of 8” to 12” of extra base on the sides for structural integrity of the walkway. With this extra base you should plan for your total dig area to be aprox 6’ wide on an average 4’ wide walkway.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can you put conduit under my walkway for a future lamp post?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, if you need any conduit under the walkway whether for power, sprinklers or anything else, just bring this up to your project consultant during the site visit and we will ensure its added to the project ticket.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'How long does it take to do a walkway?',

      }, {
        name: 'I have ugly concrete stairs. What can you do with these?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">There are many options when it comes to stairs next to a walkway, options will vary drastically in price and not all options are available for every project.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'I want to re-do my entire front including plants, Can you remove my existing landscape?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, please mention this idea to your project consultant during the site visit and we can plan to prep your entire front so that you're ready to go once the walkway is complete.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can I walk on my walkway once its complete?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes unlike concrete where it has to dry, pavers are ready to walk on as soon as the project is complete.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can I use a snowblower on my walkway?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, most pavers are snowblower safe and are easy to shovel.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Will my paver walkway be slippery like bricks?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No, unlike bricks pavers do not hold as much moisture and provide more textures making them much less slippery than a traditional brick or natural stone product.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What design options do you recommend for my walkway?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Though each project is different, a common practice we recommend in walkways is to have a “Fan” open to the driveway, typically 2 feet wider than the walkway, then a “Fan” open to the steps creating a landing area of the bottom of the steps.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'My walkway puddles now, will the new walkway puddle?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No, your new walkway will not puddle. Most old walkways that puddle, puddle because they are sloped the wrong way, they sit too low compared to the grass or there are simply low spots in the walkway. All of this will be corrected with your new walkway installation.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'My walkway is on a slope, what can I do?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">You have a couple options when your walkway is on a slope, depending upon your end goal, we can either add steps into the walkway creating a “landing” area in between steps that eventually leads to the top of the hill. This is usually the most practical solution and provides the best estetic. However, not everyone likes steps. In this case we could “Ramp” the walkway depending upon the slope we would recommend the best pavers for this and design a solution that works.</p>`

      {
        name: 'How long is the initial site visit on a patio project?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">We asked customers to set aside 30min to 60min for an initial site visit This will give us plenty of time to discuss the project, answer any questions you may have and allow us time to properly document the project description.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What\'s the average size patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Though we get this questions a lot there is no “Right” answer, patio size is designed around what you want to do with it, someone who is looking for a simple patio, fire pit area and bistro table hangout may only need a 300sq foot patio, while a customer who is looking to entertain an entire family and who wants to create a truly outdoor living area may be in the area of 1,000+ square feet. Your project consultant will be able to suggest some sizes based on your yard, house and ultimate goals. On average most customers end up with a patio between 500 and 1,000sq ft.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What size pavers do you recommend for a patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">We would suggest a larger block paver for patios, the industry as a whole is transitioning to this larger block look, and the overall estic of larger blocks reduce the number of lines in the patio, reduces the need for poly sand maintenance and provides an overall cleaner look for large patios.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can I have a double or triple border around my patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, because patio areas are wider its possible to have multiple borders, our most popular border option in patios is to include a “Double” border, this usually includes an “inlay” accent color along with a smaller outside border in the same matching color as the core patio. This look really makes a patio pop. Your project consultant will recommend options for your patio based on your surroundings and house colors.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can I mix colors within my patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod">Yes you can mix colors within the core design, we have done projects where customers have chosen to mix all sorts of colors to create their own “look”</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Should I bring the pavers up to the house or keep a landscape bed?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">This really falls under personal preference, however there are pros and cons to each. When bringing pavers all the way up to the foundation you create a maintenance free area and depending upon your yard this could be valuable extra patio space. However in an area where you have more room, it's best to keep the patio away from the house since it's unlikely people will “Sit” next to the house and this is a waste of patio space. Instead this area turned into a landscape bed will help hide any imperfections in the foundation and allow you to either save money or take that space and expand the patio outward where the space will be utilized better.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'My patio is near my septic, is that a problem?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No, typically we are able to work right near septic areas in some cases we are even able to work over septic areas. This is project dependent but ask your project consultant is you have any concerns.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do I need a permit for my patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">In most towns and cities you do NOT need a permit for paver patio construction, however your local project consultant will advise you of anything local permits if needed.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do you pull the permits if a permit is needed?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No, United Hardscapes does not pull permits for customers, however we provide all the details, site plan and documents required for a customer to easily pull a permit if needed.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do patios increase the value of my property?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, a well designed and purposeful patio will add value to your property and years of enjoyment to your friends and family. Though patios and most hardscape will add value to a property it typically will not add any additional taxes to the property.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can you help me design my patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, our project consultants are trained on what to look for so that you have a patio that fits your needs and looks appealing.</p>`

        name: 'Can I add onto my patio in the future without it looking weird?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, there are ways to add onto an existing patio without it looking weird, whether this involves utilizing the same pavers or designing a new extension United Hardscapes will find a way to ensure your patio extension looks like it was planned all along.</p>`

        name: 'Do you remove decks or concrete that are in the way of where I want to put a patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, our crews our trained on how to properly remove decks and cut out concrete so that your new patio can be installed nearly anywhere.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can you help me design landscaping around my new patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, all of our 3D designs comes with a “Landscape” options showing you what your patio could look like fully landscaped.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'My patio will need steps out the back door, what are my options?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Your project consultant will have an opinion on your step options based on the site visit and your unique situation. However, most customers will choose a solid granite step/landing option for their back steps since this is the most durable long lasting type of steps for patio areas. For a more cost effective option, its suggested to coordinate with a carpenter after the patio is complete and install a set of Trex/Azek type steps that would land right on top of the patio.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Will rodents like chipmunks ruin my patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No, As long as the proper base and sub soil is prepared correctly you will not have to worry about rodents undermining you new patio.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'The area where I want my patio is way out of level, what are my options?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Your project consultant would have the final say here with suggestions, however the two most common solutions are to either add a retaining wall that can either be cut into a hill or can be used to build up to support your new patio. Secondly if there is room, it's possible to grade around your patio and utilize landscaping to cover up the slope, this tends to be a more cost effective way to take care of hills.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Should I elevate my patio or keep it ground level?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">This is a personal preference when it comes to the looks, we have done many patios that utilize a combination of elevations and steps to build into their backyard, and in some cases it really makes sense to build on multiple levels. The other side of this is that if it's not needed to add levels, then it may be an unnecessary cost, once you start to add raised areas and sections the const drastically increases and unless you have the room to really separate the level of your patio its suggested to keep your patio ground level and instead separate areas with designs instead of levels saving on cost and increasing your useable space.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can you go over my existing concrete patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Maybe. There are many things we look for before we commit to being able to go over existing concrete, some items include the condition/base of the existing concrete patio, the height clarence between the patio and your doors, and can everything drain the right way are just some of the many things we will need to know in order to determine if we can go over existing concrete. However, if everything checks out, yes we can go over existing concrete patios.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can you provide a 3D design of my patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes, we offer complimentary 3D designs on all of our hardscaping projects, Once you accept your proposal you could request a 3D design at that time, you will have two options, either you can look at materials first to get an idea of what you like and then we would build your design to your chosen materials or you can request your project consultant to put together a design for what they think would look best on your property.</p>`

        name: 'What are the most common elements to a patio?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Its most common for customers to add on a fire pit and sitting wall and even design to their patio, infact it’s so common we have a name for it, it's called our Entertainment Package. This package includes everything you need to entertain your family or friends.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What happens if it rains during my patio installation?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">No need to worry, rain does not harm your patio installation, in fact a little water is even better for compaction. If however the weather is a total washout, your project consultant will reach out to you to let you know the crew won't be arriving that day and they will resume the following day weather permitting.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'What happens if the patio was too wet to spread poly sand?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">In order to install polymeric sand properly the pavers should be mostly dry, if it was raining out the day your project was completed or if the pavers were simply still too wet to sand, then the crew will finish up your project and schedule a day in the future to come back and poly sand when the project has dried.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Can I walk on my patio even though it has not been sanded?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Yes you can walkway on the patio, however without the poly sand or compaction to finish off the project you may notice some of the pavers “loose” or “slightly uneven” All of this is corrected during the last step of packing and sanding.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'How long does it take you to sand the patio and do I have to be home when you complete it?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">Typically packing and sanding will take less than 30min to complete and no, you do not have to be home for this to happen.</p>`
      }, {
        name: 'Do you recommend seed, hydro seed or sod after my project is completed?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">This is a question really based on budget and desire. All three of these options are viable to get new grass after a construction project, however cost is a large factor. Traditional grass seed is the least expensive route but is the slowest to grow and take hold, while sod is the best option, but most expensive. Hydro see is a good middle ground for many folks since the yard is raked and prepped already and needs to just be blasted. Since every job is unique in the amount of “disturbded” yard it's best to ask your project consultant what they recommend and get an estimate on whatever option suits your needs the best.</p>`

        name: 'What type of fire pits do you offer/recommend?',
        content: `<p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">There are three types of fire pits that are most common with paver patios, the first is the traditional stone/block fire pit that is most commonly used and is a standard 48” wide and typically matches the patio. These are great for wood burning and are economical in cost.</p>
                  <p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">The second type of firepit is similar to the above but is would “Gas” instead of wood burning, its nice to be able to turn on a fire pit and run it directly off your house gas/propane line, however there is an extreme price increase between these first two options, when you go with a hard line like this to the fire pit, you need to get the town involved with permits, the gas company would have to install and connect the burner up and the accessories needed for the installation tend to add aprox $3,000 to $3,500 to the project cost, for most people this is quite a bit for a fire pit.</p>
                  <p class="color-cape-cod m-0 mt-10">The third option that has been gaining popularity is the Elegant propane fire pits, these are typically square, larger fire pits that have a propane tank inside them (hidden) these fire pits are usually portable but still are heavy duty and won't blow away or fall apart.</p>`

We will given a quick estimate right online, worked with Nick our project consultant to see available materials and got the job completed only 3 weeks after we picked out the materials.  What a simple process and great company to work with.'

    comment: 'All we wanted was a simple patio for our back yard, we had called others for a quote and many companies were to busy for our small project or gave us some complicated extremely over priced estimate. United Hardscapes on the only hand was able to provide us an estimate online, came out to our house to help us design the patio and got it completed within our budget (and even allowed us to add a fire pit). We could not be happerier with United Hardscapes.'

We ended finding United Hardscapes through a family member who recommended one of their patio packages (Entertainment package) This had everything we wanted included, so we contacted United Hardscapes and they customized this package to our back yard. Outstanding workmanship and design ideas.'

This company has it all , economical solution\'s, great service, beautiful work.'
